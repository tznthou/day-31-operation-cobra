A stealth game designed for office workers. The interface looks like a work application, but hides classic games inside (Snake + 2048). Press Esc to instantly pause and disguise the game — perfect for when the boss walks by.

> **"Looks like work, feels like play."**

---

## Core Concept

This is a game **dressed in work clothes**.

Six disguise skins, six different "I'm working" illusions: Google search, Excel spreadsheet, Jira board, Slack chat, Notion docs, VS Code editor. Games (Snake or 2048) hide in a small widget at the bottom-right corner. Press Esc and it transforms into a clock — boss-proof.

You're not playing a game, you're finding **an escape valve for stress**.

## Reflections

### Disclaimer for My Boss

> Dear Boss, I work diligently during office hours, I promise! This is just a side project I built after work to practice coding and improve my skills. Please don't fire me because of this — I'm really serious about my job! 🙏

### Why "Operation Cobra"?

The cobra is the most iconic image in Snake games. And "Operation" suggests this is a covert mission — secretly slacking off right under the boss's nose.

### The Case for Slacking

The Japanese have a word "サボる" (saboru, derived from French "sabotage"), meaning to slack off at work. But slacking isn't necessarily bad — moderate rest can improve efficiency, while forcing yourself to focus for long periods actually reduces output.

This game exists as a gentle protest against "work-above-all" culture.

### Why These Six Skins?

- **Google**: Searching is the most innocent activity — who doesn't need to look things up?
- **Excel**: Spreadsheets look the most "professional" — no one dares disturb you
- **Jira**: Standard equipment for agile teams — checking tickets is legitimate work
- **Slack**: Team communication is essential — who says this isn't work?
- **Notion**: Writing docs is serious business — planning projects is totally legitimate
- **VS Code**: The ultimate disguise — pretending to code, who dares say you're slacking?

These six scenarios cover almost all office "safe zones."
